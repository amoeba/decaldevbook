# Setup

Getting set up for Decal plugin development is similar to gettting set up for developing application in C# so you may already have some of these components.
We need to install:

- Asheron's Call
- Decal
- Visual Studio
- .NET Framework 2.0

Installation instructions for Asheron's Call can be found elsewhere (such as [GDLE](https://www.gdleac.com/)) and Decal can be found at [decaldev.com](https://www.decaldev.com/).
